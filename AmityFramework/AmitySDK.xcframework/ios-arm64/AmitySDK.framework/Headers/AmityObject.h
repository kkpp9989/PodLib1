/// Life cycle of live object observation is directly tied to its token. Once token is deallocated, observation ends.

/// var token: AmityNotificationToken?
/// var userRepo: AmityUserRepository?
///
/// token = userRepo?.getUser("user-id").observe { liveObject, error in
///     // Whenever property of live object changes, this block gets called

/// To stop observation, you can just set `token = nil`.
